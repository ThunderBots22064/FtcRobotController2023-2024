# Quick Start
Hello! This file is being used as a guide (possibly in an emergency) to driving the robot.
The robot is simple to drive so just follow along!

## Gamepad 1 - Drivetrain Driver
The role of the drivetrain driver is to get the robot where it needs to go.
First to move the robot around use
- Left Joystick (Left/Right) - Move the robot to the left/right of yourself
- Right Joystick (Up/Down) - Move the robot away/towards yourself

A **VERY VERY** important command is
- Start + DPad Up - Reset IMU Heading
This keybinding resets the IMU's heading. The IMU Heading works as a way to calculate which way
the robot is facing relative to you. This dictates how the robot will move. To use this simply
rotate the robot so the front is facing away from you and reset the IMU. This will get you back to
driving in no time.

You're almost there! Now to control the speed of the robot use
- Right Bumper - Increase speed by an increment
- Left Bumper - Decrease speed by an increment

And that's all for Gamepad 1! Have fun driving!

## Gamepad 2 - Control Surface Driver
The role of the Control Surface driver is to manipulate all the control surfaces of the robot to
actually allow it to do things during matches.

Here's a list of keybindings that should prove helpful
### Drone
- X (Held down) - Launches the drone

### Hook
- Y (Held Down) - Moves the hook up
- A (Held Down) - Moves the hook down

### Arm and Claw
- Left Stick (Up/Down) - Raises/Lowers the arm
- Right Trigger (Held Down) - Closes the claw
- Left Trigger (Held Down) - Opens the claw

That's all!! Have fun and good luck!
